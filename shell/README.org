#+TITLE: shell

shell configuration, alias, coloring, git integration for zsh and
bash.

*** How does it works?

The =~/.bashrc= and =~/.zshrc= loads the available config's from
=~/.shellrc.d= when the shell starts. It add one more level of
*re-direction* to achieve this result.

Here is the *Summary* of snippets in [[shellrc.d][shellrc.d]].
